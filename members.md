<b>年糕</b> (rice cake in English) is an indoor cat that specialising in being cute and comforting. He was born in Lille, France in 2017 and grew up in Montpellier in the south of France. He then moved with me to the Netherlands and resided in Delft, then to York the UK. He holds a French passport (So he can travel freely in EU without needing a visa while I still need to apply for visa when I want to come back to Europe). He <b>DOES NOT</b> speak French or English.
